# Day 2 labs

In these labs, you will train a Machine Learning (ML) model to detect anomalies. Next, you will deploy the model for real-time scoring and create a stream processing pipeline to predict anomalies in real time from simulated IoT devices.

To start, [follow the lab instructions to complete labs 1 - 3](<Labs 1-3 - AI model training and deployment/README.md>), using Jupyter notebooks.

After you have successfully executed all the notebooks for labs 1 - 3, [continue to lab 4](<Lab 4 - Stream processing and real-time scoring/README.md>).
